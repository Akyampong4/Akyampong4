A small mouse was enjoying a piece of cheese in a field when a pride of lions spotted him. The mouse froze in fear, but then he had a daring idea. He leaped onto the back of the nearest lion, startling the entire pride. The quick mouse scurried down the lion's back and ran away as fast as he could, with the lions in pursuit. He reached his burrow and dove inside just in time, leaving the frustrated lions outside. The brave mouse took a deep breath, relieved to have escaped again. He knew he was a survivor and smiled proudly.
       
**Moral of the story:** Even the smallest creatures can be brave and resourceful.
